# YRKSpinningProgressIndicator

by Kelan Champagne (http://yeahrightkeller.com)

Please feel free to send me questions or comments.


## Overview

YRKSpinningProgressIndicator is a clone of the "Spinning style"
NSProgressIndicator that can be set to an arbitrary size and color. The
background color can also be set, or it can be transparent. You can even
change the color in real-time while it's animating. SPIDemo is an app to demo
its use.


## Version History

* v1.4  2014-05-29  novawave fork: clean-up for submission as cocoapod, pull falkobuttler's changes for ARC support
* v1.3  2010-09-06  Pulled fixes, name improvements from mikeabdulla and
  uncomplex.
  NOTE: This version is not backwards-compatible with
  previous versions due to the name changes.
* v1.2  2009-12-21  Added determinate mode and threaded animation, mostly via
email from Rowan Beentje (from SequelPro).
* v1.1  2009-02-14  Fixes from Eric Roccasecca.
* v1.0  2008-07-08  Initial Release.


## Features

* Can be set to arbitrary size and color.
    * Can even be changed while animating.
* Background color can be set arbitrarily or be transparent.
* Has determinate mode that is a pie-chart of the progress.
* Mostly compatible with OS X 10.4 (Tiger).  I think there might be some issues
  with the run modes with the NSTimer-based animation, but I don't have access
  to a Tiger machine right now, so I can't check.


## Code Architecture

* Implemented as a subclass of NSView.
* Animation is done with an NSTimer, or on a separate thread (when
  setUsesThreadedAnimation:YES).  You can even swap between the two while the
  animation is running.


## Code Conventions

* Instance variables are prefixed with an underscore (i.e. "_").
